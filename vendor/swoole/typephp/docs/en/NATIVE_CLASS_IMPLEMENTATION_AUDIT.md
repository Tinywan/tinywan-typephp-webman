# Native Class Implementation Acceptance Matrix

> Audit date: 2026-08-17  
> This document records the requirements, implementation entry points, and direct verification evidence for the `#[Native]` object model. It is the implementation-acceptance attachment for
> [NATIVE_CLASS_OBJECT.md](NATIVE_CLASS_OBJECT.md) and does not replace the semantic design document.

## 1. Acceptance principles

Every capability must simultaneously have:

1. a clear language boundary;
2. a locatable compiler or PHPX implementation;
3. direct evidence in positive PHPT, negative PHPUnit, or PHPX C++ unit tests.

Code alone, documentation alone, or "no failure currently observed" does not count as complete. Native Objects have no Zend representation, so any cross-boundary behavior that cannot be statically proven safe must be rejected before generating C++.

## 2. Object model and code generation

## 9. Current verification commands

```bash
./run-tests.php -j4 --compiler ./tpc tests/compiler/native-class/
vendor/bin/phpunit phpunit/src/NativeClass/NativeClassValidationTest.php
/home/swoole/workspace/aot/phpx/build/bin/phpx-tests \
  --gtest_filter='wren_gc.*:native_gc.*'
```

The results of this Iterator-focused run were: `iterator.phpt` 1/1, Native Class PHPUnit 136/136,
ordinary foreach regression 14/14. The Native Class PHPT directory currently has 71 items; per the current task agreement, the full
tests for that directory and the compiler PHPT suite were not re-run this time, and are left for the next unified regression round.
